<h1>The Best Animes According to Jamal</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 animes of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>FullMetal Alchemist: Series</h3>
<p>Both Fullmetal aclhemist and brother hood are two of the same but are 
   completly different entities. One is around the ruling of religion on the powers 
   withen and the other is when those powers are misused for war and armys</p>

<h3>Cowboy Bebop</h3>
<p>Cult classic. From the music to the character designs to the animation. Cowboy Bebop has shapped 
   many different animes for generations to come.</p>

<h3>Dragon Ball Series</h3>
<p>As much as anyone would admit, anime would be nothing without the dragonball seires. Even to right now it has shapped 
   anime in ways that no other has.
